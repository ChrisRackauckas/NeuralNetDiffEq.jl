# Solving ODEs with Neural Networks

For ODEs, [see the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/dev/solvers/ode_solve#NeuralNetDiffEq.jl-1)
for the `nnode(chain,opt=ADAM(0.1))` algorithm, which takes in a Flux.jl chain
and optimizer to solve an ODE. This method is not particularly efficient, but
is parallel. It is based on the work of:

[Lagaris, Isaac E., Aristidis Likas, and Dimitrios I. Fotiadis. "Artificial neural networks for solving ordinary and partial differential equations." IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 9, no. 5 (1998): 987-1000.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9705023.pdf)
