# NeuralNetDiffEq

NeuralNetDiffEq.jl , which consists neural network solvers for differential equations such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep BSDE solvers, is a package of scientific machine learning (SciML).
It utilizes deep neural networks and neural stochastic differential equations to solve high dimensional PDEs.
